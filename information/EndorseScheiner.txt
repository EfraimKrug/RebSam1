In the last few years, great efforts have been made to invigorate synagogue life. I feel quite confident that the series of prayerbooks which Kavanah Life is slated to publish in the next several years, G-D willing, will be a positive and effective tool in drawing more Jews into synagogue services. I find this project to be of vital importance to the future of Jewish spiritual life. I strongly urge that it be granted every measure of support possible so that it will succeed in its noble and all important task
