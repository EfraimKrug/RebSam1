Kavanah Life is an ambitious and novel attempt to address the issue of Jewish spirituality in America.  Kavanah Life reaches into the deepest layers of Judaism, peeling away the hard shell to liberate the heart and soul of this 3500-year old spiritual tradition.  No one in contemporary America has as yet tried to do this in a systematic way.  If anyone has a chance of pulling this off and seeding a contemporary spiritual renewal, it is Rabbi Sam Intrator.  Kavanah Life deserves to be supported.  American Jews need Kavanah Life.   
Rabbi Irwin Kula, President, CLAL
