Rabbi Sam Intrator is an authentic American-Hasid. He has been able to restore the vibrancy and openness to a broad corner of the American Jewish community by mining the deep richness and energy of that Hasidic tradition. Such a restorational activity is critical to an American Jewish revival. But restoration is not enough. There must also be a progressive component. That component must not only catch the imagination of a young American community, but also provide it with texts and canisters through which to build and store and meaning. This is what Rabbi Intrator is providing. I cannot state strongly enough how crucial this task is or how uniquely suited Rabbi Intrator is to accomplish it. I hope that the community will support his endeavor and reap the rich benefit that it will bring.  Rabbi Michael Paley, Executive Director of Synagogue and Communal Affairs,
