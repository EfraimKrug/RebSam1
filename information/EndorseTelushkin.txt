Rabbi Sam Intrator is doing extraordinarily important work in showing how Jewish teachings can infuse one's life with meaning. I believe that the prayer book commentary on which he is now working will open the siddur to thousands and thousands of people, both to those unfamiliar with its contents and to those who have been praying without fully understanding the significance of their prayers. Rabbi Intrator and his work throughout Kavanah Life will, I believe, help shape and influence Jewish life for many years to come.
