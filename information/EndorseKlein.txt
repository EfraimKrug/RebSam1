KavanahLife’s  Prayer Book Series will astound its readers with its teachings and remind all of us why we identify with the Jewish people.  At this time of spiritual crisis in American history, we need Rabbi Intrator to give us grounding in our vibrant heritage.  I unequivocally offer my personal support to Rabbi Intrator’s work, and look forward to utilizing it with my students at the University of Southern California. 
Rabbi Jonathan D. Klein, Director, USC Hillel, CA
