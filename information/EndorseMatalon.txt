We are rabbis of Congregation B’nai Jeshurun, an 1,800 household synagogue community on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. We believe that Rabbi Intrator’s book constitutes a major contribution to the Jewish library and to Jews throughout the Jewish spectrum.  He will give a new voice to old and revered Rabbinic and Hasidic teachings that will uplift prayer, both individually and communally, and thus lift Jewish souls unto God’s presence.
