I have read some excerpts from Rabbi Intrator’s commentary on the Siddur.  He offers us a commentary full of vitality, insight, and energy.  This Siddur will undoubtedly enrich the prayer life of thousands and help create the needed renaissance of the Jewish people.  Any effort that strengthens Rabbi Intrator’s work and assures the future of KavanahLife will be a great blessing for the Jewish spirit and for the future of the Jewish community.
