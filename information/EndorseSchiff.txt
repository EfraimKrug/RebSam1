This exciting program has the potential of bringing the rich heritage of our Jewish faith into the lives of many Jews and enabling them to absorb the inspirational message that Judaism offers.I have known Rabbi Intrator for several years and have found him to be a man of great knowledge, deep faith, very warm and genuine in personality and one whose love for Jews and Judaism makes him an exceptional teacher.  I would commend him for his work and support his noble efforts on behalf of the Jewish people.
